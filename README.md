- `script.py` to see all visualizations
- `data/Global_AI_Content_Impact_Dataset.csv` to understand the data
- Images are optional branding assets

## üßë‚Äçüíª Technologies Used

- Python
- Plotly Express
- Pandas
- Preswald platform
- (Optional simulation for PCA clustering)

## üì¨ scope for improvement 

1. Support all complex Python libraries 
‚úÖ Enhance library support: Allow popular libraries like sklearn, seaborn, scipy, etc. This would open doors to advanced analytics (e.g., clustering, forecasting) directly inside dashboards.
2. Improve error visibility (don't just "no preview")
 ‚úÖ Better Exception Handling: If certain libraries fail or visualizations break, Preswald should automatically capture the error, display a clean message, and guide the user on possible fixes ‚Äî instead of leaving blank screens.
3. Improve user interface
 ‚úÖ UI/UX Enhancements: The current interface can be polished further for smoother navigation, better organization of projects, and clearer buttons for common actions like Preview, Publish, Download, etc.
